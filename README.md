Hello 360Solutions Team,

I look forward to meeting all of you soon. This coding assessment was very fun. I wrote the solution using React.js and Node.js. 
The functions meet all requirements and are designed to easily accept additional employees in the JSON object. Essentially, The pages adapt to the creation of employees in the JSON object. I realize supporting the addition of users may have added some extra complexity/accounting for edge cases. However, I believe it is a crucial part of programming to make the code tolerant to change.


I used VSCode to write this application. I used the chrome developer tools to debug. Furthermore, I tested adding employees in many different ways to find bugs and resolve them.

The two additional tasks are:

5. . Extension of task 2: Supervisor’s best customer should be based off their team’s best customer if the supervisor has not sold to a customer with a higher amount. If the supervisor has sold to a customer with a higher amount than any of their team member’s customers, then that should be their best customer.

6. Employees should be able to easily view how teams are doing overall. If a supervisor's name is clicked it should show the supervisor's team invoices as well as the supervisor's individual invoices.

To run the development environment (is slower to initialize, but data can be added to the JSON objects):
1.install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.from the terminal in 360cloudsolutionstest folder: <br/>
    npm i --no-audit <br/>
    npm start <br/>


To run the production environment:
1. install Node.js if not already installed
2. from the terminal in 360cloudsolutionstest folder <br/>
    npm i --no-audit  <br/>
	npm run build  <br/>
	npm i serve --no-audit -g <br/>


Thank you so much for considering me for this position. I look forward to meeting you!
