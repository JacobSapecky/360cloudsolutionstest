Hello 360Solutions Team,

I look forward to meeting all of you soon. This coding assessment was very fun. I wrote the solution using React.js and Node.js. 
The functions meet all requirements and are designed to easily accept additional employees in the JSON object. Essentially, The pages adapt to the creation of employees in the JSON object. I realize supporting the addition of users may have added some extra complexity/accounting for edge cases. However, I believe it is a crucial part of programming to make the code tolerant to change.


I used VSCode to write this application. I used the chrome developer tools to debug. Furthermore, I tested adding employees in many different ways to find bugs and resolve them.
